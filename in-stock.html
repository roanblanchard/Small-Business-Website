            This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens.
            <br> 
            The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. 
            <br> 
            It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. 
            <br> 
            Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. 
            <br> 
            The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. 
            <br> 
            Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. 
            <br> 
            Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.
            <br>

            With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. 
            <br>
            But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. 
            <br>
            Tolerates shade well. 
            <br>
            **Warning: this plant is poisonous.**

            <b>Crown Imperials:</b> 
            <br>
            Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, making rapid growth in the spring, flowering during April/early May and dying down in early summer.

            Best in raised beds or planters.
            <br> 
            Does not tolerate shade; needs a warm, sunny position where it can be left undisturbed for many years.

            <br>
            These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial flowers to chase the winter doldrums away. 
            <br>

            They can get up to half a foot tall with a similar spread. 
            <br>
            Each bulb will produce numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green foliage.
            <br>
            Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.
